# Freelancing Unlocked: Mastering the Art of Independent Data Science

These notes are from the informal Sunday discussion I led at Data Day Texas, 2025. The session was a chance for attendees to ask questions and share their experiences with freelancing in the data science field.  All comments were off the record, and I have anonymized the content to protect the privacy of the participants.

### Key Takeaways

- Obtaining health insurance is a major concern.
- Formalizing a business structure can help with liability, but it is important to understand how this varies by state and country.  For example, not all states provide protection for single-member LLCs (AKA "disregarded entities").
- Get a lawyer for setting up the business structure and helping to write contracts.
- Tax implications for LLCs versus S-Corps vary.  Get an accountant to help with this.
- Discussion on the importance of keeping business and personal banking accounts separate and various bookkeeping tools.
  - Xero was referenced as being easier than QuickBooks.
- Various contract vehicles were discussed.  In particular, participants found value in having a master agreement in place that then could have tasks written against it.
- There was a lot of discussion on getting clients with many different strategies considered.  The bottom line was to not worry about posting similar content in multiple places since it would reach more of your network.
- One attendee discussed the importance of knowing what the minimum thing you could do to add value.
- There was discussion on how to chase late payments, which was a common pain point.  One suggestion was to charge a small amount for "discovery" up front, which would be used for scoping of the work.
- There were varying opinions on whether it was better to be a generalist or a specialist.
