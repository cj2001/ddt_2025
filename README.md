This repository contains my content for the two talks I gave at Data Day Texas, 2025:

- "Empowering Change: Building and Sustaining a Data Culture from the Ground Up" (located in `data_culture_talk/`)
- "From Office Cubicles to Independent Success: How to Create a Career and Thrive as a Freelance Data Scientist" (located in `freelancing_talk/`)

It also contains the notes from the two Sunday informal sessions I led:

- ["Freelancing Unlocked: Mastering the Art of Independent Data Science"](discussion_notes/freelancing.md)
- ["Navigating the Challenges of Deploying Generative AI in the Real World"]()
